# Kwesi Baba's Helpful-portfolio

This portfolio was built using 2 free html templates (Present and Visualize), animate css, modernizr,
and skeljs for browser breakpoints.
A lightbox feature will be implemented in the future as well as firebase for a contact form.


## What I Have Learnt

- Using flexbox for image galleries
- Using skeljs to configure browser breakpoints for mobile responsiveness
- Trying to configure footer so it remains at the bottom of the page, no matter the amount of content on the page
